start the server (server.js) with command

### `node server.js`

then run the client

cd client

### `npm start`

server runs on localhost:3000 client asks if we want to run on another port since server is already running on port 3000 type 'y' or 'yes', client selects nearest port to server, usually 3001 and react app opens in browser
